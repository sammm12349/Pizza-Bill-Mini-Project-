# Pizza-Bill-Mini-Project-
This project generates a bill for a pizza being made using OOP in Java 
This Java console application is used to simulate a pizza shop's billing system.
This project demonstrates core object‐oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
The user can choose pizza types, extras, and packaging; the system will calculate the final bill.


Features
- Choice between pizza types (e.g. regular/deluxe)
- Choose if your pizza will be vegetarian or non-vegetarian
- Add any extra toppings and cheese (if appropriate)
- Add packaging/takeaway charges
- See a detailed breakdown of your bill: base price + extras + packaging = total

Clean, modular code structure using classes such as `Pizza`, `NormalPizza`, `DeluxePizza` etc. ---
